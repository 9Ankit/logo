# NSheet

This library was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.2.0. Created using the example provided [here](https://medium.com/@tomsu/how-to-build-a-library-for-angular-apps-4f9b38b0ed11).

## Development

1. Create an Angular App via the CLI using `ng new appname`.
1. In the CLI execute `ng generate library n-sheet` to create a library inside an Angular App. A library called n-sheet will now be created inside the projects folder (which will be created for you if it did not already exist).
2. Now copy and overwrite the contents of this repo into the n-sheet folder that resides within the projects folder.
3. Build the library using the commands mentioned in the Build section.
4. Then import the following using `import { NSheetDirective } from 'n-sheet';` & `import { HttpClientModule }  from '@angular/common/http';` into your app.module.ts.
4. In the app.module.ts file within th `@NgModule` tag add `NSheetDirective` to your declarations and exports and add `HttpClientModule` to your imports.
5. You should now be able to use the directive in your app.component.ts and .html files to test and develop.
 

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name --project n-sheet` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module --project n-sheet`.
> Note: Don't forget to add `--project n-sheet` or else it will be added to the default project in your `angular.json` file. 

## Build

Run `ng build n-sheet` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use `ng build n-sheet --watch` while developing a library to always have the latest build on run.

## Publishing

After building your library with `ng build n-sheet`, go to the dist folder `cd dist/n-sheet` and run `npm publish`.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test n-sheet` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
